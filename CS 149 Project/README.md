## File Structure

MergeSortTask and QuickSortTask will perform these 2 algorithms concurrently. algo_test.java will do the unit tests of these sorting algorithms to make sure they properly sort. SortingThreads will be a class that will perform the 2 multithreaded sorts. Sort Test will be the main method where we will make the print statements for our results.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies (for the junit jar)

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
